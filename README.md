## Make Moons
### [[Notebook]](MakeMoons/MakeMoons.ipynb)

Training a NN using Sklearn's **make_moons** dataset with Pytorch to visualize non-linear predictions given by a Neural Network.
- TODO: compare the results with a Logistic Regression.

## Digit recognizer
### [[Notebook]](DigitRecognizer/DigitRecognizer.ipynb)

Training a CNN to recognize handwritten numbers using Sklearn's **digits** dataset with Pytorch. This is multi-label classification task and aims to understand different tools and visualizations for classification such as:

- visualize distribution per class (for train and validation split also)
- sklearn's classification report
- sklearn's confusion matrix

## Bob Ross's paintings segmentation
### [[Notebook]](BobRoss/BobRoss.ipynb)


UNet semantic segmentation of Bob Ross paintings.
Still in progress. Aimed to understand:

- FCNN
- Train a small Net with small data (dataset has ~200 samples)
- Struggle with hyperparams
